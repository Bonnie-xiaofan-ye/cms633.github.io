I have made some small changes to the instruction sample for the visualization of the collection of silk products in the Harvard Art Museum. The use of silk in the fabric can reflect the development of the textile industry in various regions. Moreover, the importation/exportation of silk products implies communication between civilizations. In addition, the styles and colors of the decorative patterns on the fabric can be deeply linked to the local textile industry and culture. Therefore, it is of remarkable significance to study the collection of silk products.
In visualization, I adapted the timeline to characterize all the collections, and it can be observed from the list of the oldest ten collections that the museum has relatively few collections between 100BCE and 1000CE, and most of the collections are from the European region after 1200CE. If data visualization is to be complicated, a map corresponding to the collected regions can be considered for representation.
