> The "secret" of interface design is to "make it go away.‚Äù -- Nicholas Negroponte

Interface design always intrigues me because it could convey the functions and purposes of a product to general users in the most natural, effective yet inconspicuous way. I like how Matt discussed the misconceptions around GUI, which indicated many real-life stereotypes regarding UIUX design. For example, the more colorful, conspicuous, or complicated the GUI is, the less trustworthy it could be in contemporary academic settings. Matt also suggested that although GUI is often not given enough time and effort during the product development stage, it should be an integral part of design. Matt further raised questions like "what role should aesthetics have in interface design?" 

Through this article, I learned about how a GUI should
- actively engage users to explore different functions rather than hiding certain tools from the interface.
- give users freedom to pull up and down a "curtain" to find all technical tools (previous/next, comparisons, enlargements, indexes, etc.) Users could arrange, label tools neatly according to their own preferences.
- ensure the main interface clean and simple.

This article provides many key characteristics to consider for our project. When we design the interface for the LGBTQ+ interactive map, we need to balance the ample information and the convinence and efficiency for navigation. We also want to ensure the aesthetic values of this map to encourage constant usage. What are some tools/functions we would love to provide to the users? What should be hidden behind the curtain while others are on the stages?
