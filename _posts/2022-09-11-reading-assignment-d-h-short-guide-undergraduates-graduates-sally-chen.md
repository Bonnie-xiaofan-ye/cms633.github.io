The first chapter focused on the definition of Digital Humanities, or what the field encompasses. During the first Lecture activity, I got the idea that digital humanities is a relatively new concept with no unified definition. I liked the way this chapter helped readers understand the definition by demonstrating “What is” and “What is not”. After the first session, my definition of digital humanities focused on digital tools and humanities research, specifically, conducting humanities research using digital tools. This chapter made me realize that it is actually a much more intertwined and complex combination. The chapter also gave a short overview of the development of digital humanities, a field that is tightly integrated with the development of computers. 

Chapter 2 focused on the characteristics of a digital humanities research project, such as who is involved, what size the projects usually are, and what are the differences between digital humanities research and traditional humanities research. The chapter emphasized the importance of teamwork and collaboration in research. Because digital humanities is a very interdisciplinary field, the outcomes of the project will be better if each member is able to maximize his or her own area of expertise and skills.
