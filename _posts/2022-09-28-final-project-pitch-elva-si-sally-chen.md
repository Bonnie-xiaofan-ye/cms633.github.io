**Problem Statement/Research Question - What problem or research question is your project trying to address?**

Women are often underrepresented or misrepresented in mass media. We want to focus on one type of media (TV dramas, films, Music, Comic, or Literature, depending on what database we could find) and investigate whether women portrayals have changed over time? Do producers/authors really mention particular body images/traits more for men than for women? Are women described using different adjectives than those attributed to men?

**Data Sources: What is the data that you will be using for your project and how will it be obtained?. Any challenges with your data that you are aware of?**

To collect this data, we want to query RapidAPI for headlines containing one or more of keywords regarding females, women, gender, etc.. 

Some database that we already found are:
- [Women in headlines]([https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/women-in-headlines](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/women-in-headlines)) [github] 
- [Marvel Comic API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/): 
- [Spotify Lyrics API]( https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

**Audience: Who is the intended audience for your project? General public, scholars, students (field/level), etc.**
General public who are interested in knowing more about how genders are represented in mass media could take a peak into our project. Scholars in Media Studies could further use our data and visualization to generate further questions.

**Inspirations: What are similar projects that could be used as an inspiration.**
