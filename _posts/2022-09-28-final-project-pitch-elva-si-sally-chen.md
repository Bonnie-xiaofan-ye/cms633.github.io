**Problem Statement/Research Question - What problem or research question is your project trying to address?**

Women are often underrepresented or misrepresented in mass media. We want to focus on one type of text-based data (Scripts, Lyrics, Comic books, or Literature, depending on what we could access) and investigate how women's portrayals have changed over time. Based on the database, we will focus on one specific aspect for the project and ask specific questions like: Do authors mention particular body images/traits more for men than for women? Are women described using different adjectives than those attributed to men?

**Data Sources: What is the data that you will be using for your project and how will it be obtained?. Any challenges with your data that you are aware of?**

We are planning to query RapidAPI or other forms of API to extract data, and we are focusing on the keywords in the text regarding females, women, etc.

Some database that we already found are:
- [Women in headlines]([https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/women-in-headlines](https://github.com/the-pudding/data/tree/master/women-in-headlines)) [github] 
- [Marvel Comic API](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/): 
- [Spotify Lyrics API]( https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)

**Audience: Who is the intended audience for your project? General public, scholars, students (field/level), etc.**
The general public who is interested in knowing more about how genders are represented in mass media could take a peak at our project. Gender inequality is a social issue that the mass has been talking about, we want to provide some insights through an “easy-to-read” article that includes our perspectives and interactive data visualizations of our project.

Scholars in Media Studies could further use our data and visualization to generate further questions. Connected with similar research projects, e.g. projects focusing on other aspects of representations of women in society, researchers may find some common perspectives.

**Inspirations: What are similar projects that could be used as an inspiration.**

**Skills needed: What are the skill sets needed to develop a digital prototype for your project? Programming, design, research, etc.**
