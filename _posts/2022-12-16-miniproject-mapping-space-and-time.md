##Mini Project:

For the mini-project, I created a time map of Melville’s Journey in time mapper. The interface was surprisingly easy to use, but you needed to get the right tabs and format for the google sheet in order to have a smooth transition. I wasn’t able to add other tabs like suggested, and I needed to filter through the Melville Data in order to not have any undefined points on the map, or points that did not translate. For the data itself, there were spots that did not include any text or details about the journey, so they are characterized as undefined on the map. A sample of the project is shown below.
