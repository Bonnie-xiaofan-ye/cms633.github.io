Data visualization presents information or ideas more directly, but humanities researchers also need to think about the logic or theoretical basis behind the use of visualization. Research on individual human beings or groups of human beings is essentially a way to collect partial information (capta) about society as a whole through different methods. The gap between the world as we perceive it and the information we record, and the gap between the original research material and the material after data visualization, can lead to differences between reality and data. Data Visualization is a powerful tool, yet humanities researchers need to be aware of its limitations and thus view the results of digital humanities more carefully.

In the next chapters, the authors focus on the way temporal and spatial information is represented through visualization. The current visualization does not accurately reflect the temporal or spatial relationships presented in the data. 
From the temporal perspective, possible problems include the ambiguity of time data and the subjective perceptions of the length of time, etc. The timeline mainly used nowadays represents time with a precise point on a straight line. However, having precise temporal points is not what commonly happens in humanities research. The authors use figures to show the possibilities of visualizing temporality, which look more complex than the usual timeline, making them seem less "straightforward". A possible improvement would be to show the different levels or categories of "y" axis information through user-interaction interfaces so that the observer can process the information within an acceptable range at one time. 
Similarly, in the section discussing visualization of space, the authors show some possible forms of visualization that do not look like the familiar "diagrams" or "maps", but they do have the potential to represent more information. For example, the prevalence of a particular cultural phenomenon in a certain area often radiates to the surrounding areas. A spatially related representation like a "heat map" may be able to better represent the extent and intensity of the impact than by highlighting the central point on the map and marking all the administrative areas affected, incorporating as much information as possible.
Developing better humanities visualization tools requires creativity and a good understanding of the disciplinary logic of humanities research. This includes an understanding of the nature of data, the methodology and logic of data processing, and the purpose of data visualization.
