What immediately stands out to me is the part: “1970s, digital as a way of extending the toolkits of traditional scholarship and opening up archives and databases to wider audiences of users.” 

At the beginning of the 1970s, when digital became a way to enable database access. I believe the most fundamental way to comprehend digital is to consider its origins, when it began as a tool for material, such as databases and archives. People utilized it to acquire information more readily, rapidly, and precisely. As an UX designer, this reminds me of the information architecture portion of the design process, which is the fundamental information architecture of the entire production and aids designers and users in easily understanding and gaining access to the required information. Like the original birth principle, digital is now inseparable from content, so I was inspired that, especially as a designer, we should pay more attention to context, research, and data in addition to digital form design, such as fancy animation and cool graphical interface.

The second relates to the relationship and complementarity between visual, screen, and text. Now that screens have totally taken over our lives, visuals play an essential role in digital humanities. Vision has become not simply a presentation tool but also a method of thinking due to the intersection of technology and humanities. This reminds me of what we frequently hear about design thinking, in which designers observe their surroundings with a critical eye in order to improve design; however, as audience, we are also influenced by the way designers express themselves, as visuals at this point include the process of constructing and communicating ideas. As stated in the text, "design can be also seen as a kind of editing", the visual expression, reconstruction, and hierarchy are based on transmitting the original basic neutral data and the process of developing and explaining the unique idea in the process of establishing the visual system.
