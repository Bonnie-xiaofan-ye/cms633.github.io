The idea of generative design serves as a tool for designers to create designs for interfaces based on use case scenarios. The matrix created can help to serve as a design framework, allowing the analysis and synthesis of functions, features, and categories. Besides, the scenarios created can serve as interface design guides, letting designers know what users seek and can explore using this interface. 
The generative design idea and the matrix lay a solid foundation for the interface design of dynamic visualization, which gives us a hint and guidance for our final project. We can also create a matrix to analyze what flows we will make and for whom we design. Currently, we have three main views of the homepage and several sub-categories of a single work display. It is the potential to create a matrix for different personas to test the completeness of our design in terms of both functions and details.
