[19th Century American Children's Book Trade Directory](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/28/)

The database contains 5962 entries documenting the activity of individuals and firms involved in the manufacture and distribution of childrens books in the United States chiefly between 1821 and 1876. It reflects the dynamic growth of childrens book production in the major publishing centers of New York (1803), Boston (1137), and Philadelphia (878). From this database, we can see an American childrens literature industry that are coming of age in the midst of stunning technological advances, sweeping social change, and great economic upheaval.
