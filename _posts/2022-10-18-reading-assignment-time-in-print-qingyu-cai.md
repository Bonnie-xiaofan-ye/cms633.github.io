The Time in Print chapter gives us an overview of how the representation of time has evolved in history starting from the mid-eleventh century. Accuracy of historical representation is not just about including more details. Instead, it is about showing the complex content of a real story while communicating the uniformity, directionality, and irreversibility of historical time. 

I agree with what the author has mentioned toward the end of the chapter that Minard’s diagram looks more accurate in terms of the complexity that has been conveyed. The chart visualizes data about the army’s number and the temperature correspondingly, allowing readers to get information about both of them and try to find the relationship between them. Besides, the change in data shows the complexity of the actual war situation, which adds one more layer to tell the story. Its complexity reminds me of another reading about data as capta, which elaborates on the humanity of digital data. It is proposed that visualization of human data should include the human feeling or understanding of data, not just the number itself. The sense of humanity can also be understood as the layer of historical context. Visualizing the historical data should include how to tell a story regarding time. History texts are records of past stories in a human context, which is the same for charts.
