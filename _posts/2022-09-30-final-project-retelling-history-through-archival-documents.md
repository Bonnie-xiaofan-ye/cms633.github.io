## Retelling the History of the German Occupation in Prague during WWII

**Problem Statement/Research Question:**
How can Digital Humanities methods offer previously unknown insights into the history of the German occupation in Prague during World War II (1941-1945), especially through the use of hardly consulted administrative docments?

**Data Sources:**
Thousands of digitized documents containing more than 4000 cases of offences against the war economy. Data from many of the documents has already been extracted and added to a searchable database. Challenge: data in two languages: Czech and German. Additional related law documents have been digitized.

**Audience:**
Historians, history students. 

**Inspirations:**
One possible example: the US-Iran Relations Project ([https://us-iran.mit.edu](https://us-iran.mit.edu))

**Skills needed:**
Database, UI/UX design, metadata, NLP (NER, topic modelling, etc.)

**Note:** This project is part of a newly funded collaboration with the Czech Academy of Science.
