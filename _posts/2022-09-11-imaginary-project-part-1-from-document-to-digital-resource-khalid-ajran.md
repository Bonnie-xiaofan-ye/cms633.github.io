I picked Laban Morey Wheaton's ledger. This ledger seems to be a log of all sorts of expenses that Wheaton paid, as evidenced by the ledger format and one of the pages being labelled "Amount expended $". Wheaton wrote it for himself, to keep track of his spendings, and manage if he needs to spend less or is on good footing. The pages are dated from 1837 to 1854 (from age 41 to 58). I'm not sure I can make out when it was written from the document, but from further reading it looks like Wheaton was a citizen of Norton, so that's likely where it was written.

I can find out from this document examples of the day-to-day expenses of someone in the mid-19th-century. especially those in the same social class as Wheaton: things like "butler", "wife when going to boston", "bible cause", and lots of payments directly to other people.

Additional information that would help clarify the document would be 1 - details of the direct payments made to other people, and why he was paying them, and 2 - clearer handwriting :I I can read only some of it

P.S. My favorite entry is one on the third page for 1000 dollars, simply labeled, "Damn this day".
