The experience with OpenRefine was new to me, I had never used a similar way of modifying data. From the text facet you can see how quickly and heavily spelling errors are corrected, even a space bar can affect the results. I didn't fully understand the logic of create project at the beginning, just how to use text facet to correct small errors. I hope to understand the whole logic of how OpenRefine work and maximize the utilization in the class.
