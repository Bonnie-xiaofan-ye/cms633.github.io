## Project Ideas
 
**Idea 1: "Memes of Evacuation"**
•	Idea: A project examining stories told in meme-form (brief social media posts, images, etc.) by and about evacuees from Ukraine during the Ukraine-Russia conflict.
o	Content: Digital archive of the memes themselves with associated metadata (e.g., viewers, likes, comments, etc.), with each meme given its own “profile”. NLP approaches will be conducted to extract topic (e.g., LDA), linguistic, semantic, and affect features (e.g., Empath, LIWC), whose results will be included in these profile pages. There may be a lot of unique ways we can visualize results from these analyses and themes extracted from the memes themselves.
o	Audience: Social and political scholars; social media experts; anyone interested in better understanding the impact of the Ukraine-Russia conflict from the perspective of those forced to evacuate their homes; school groups.
o	Technology: In addition to NLP, I’m not sure what technologies would be used to create the digital archive itself.
o	Core Question: What can we learn about the experiences of those involved through the memes created and shared during this conflict?  

**Idea 2: "In a Word"**
•	Idea: Analyze the usage of a single word across a large corpus of multiple platforms, contexts, situations, to see how a word lives today. Create a simple, clean, and replicable process that can be used to study individual words in other contexts. I’d be interested in a word with particular social interest at this time in history, such as “climate.”
o	Content: It could have a primarily digital presentation (e.g., website) or a scholarly paper. A website could be used to visualize different ways the word has been used, and changed, over a long period of time. This could include etymologies, timelines, comparison of usage across media types and contexts, and any other visualizations or representations that my teammates find interesting. 
o	Audience: Linguists; artists; educators
o	Technology: Website, various visualization tools.
o	Core Question: What can we learn about a single word, and the topics associated with it, by exploring it intensely?
