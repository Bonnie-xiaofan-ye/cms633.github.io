Drucker examines a fundamental problem that audiences view statistical representations of data as objective fact, often forgetting the representation can be often filled with biases; Representations such as graphs, tables, and charts are also just observed interpretations of natural phenomena. I agree with this point of view, but this leads to another rabbit hole; the author is suggesting that statistical representations can no longer be considered objective pieces of evidence for arguments, or stepping stones to base other conclusions on. And if this is the case, theories concerning society cannot be formed. There must be some base level of trust within statistical representations in order to gain a fundamental understanding of societal structures.
