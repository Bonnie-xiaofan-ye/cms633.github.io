### Final Project

- Content:  a travel map for queers in China

- Audience: queer tourists coming from other cities and local queers

- Technology: a mobile app

- Data: By creating queer friendly index based on the Healthcare Equality Index from Human Rights Campaign (not sure)

- Core questions: In order to provide gay visitors to the new city with an index of queer-friendly businesses and information about local queer events, an index of queer-friendly businesses will be compiled. Since people do not know the local culture in a new city and do not know how much of their identity they should reveal, the queer friendly index was created. Besides, for those who wish to participate in local events in China, there is no official and visible notification, but rather an underground, small-group exchange of information. In order to facilitate the exchange, local queers can also utilize this application and contribute to the expansion of the overall database.
