Digital Humanities emphasize implementing transmedia designs to expand the range of humanistic knowledge, using graphical methods of knowledge organization, and building transferrable tools, environments, and platforms for scholars' collaboration. The emerging subject has many advantages. For example, it expands the scope, quality, and visibility of humanistic research. However, it is worth noting that the mere use of digital tools for humanistic research and communication is not DH.
 Digital Humanities allows for toggling back and forth between multiple views of the same materials. Unlike the traditional humanities in which print products can only be reissued in a new edition to be revised, digital knowledge can be revised at a rapid pace.
