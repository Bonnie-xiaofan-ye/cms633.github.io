## a. Problem Statement/Research Question
The aim of this project is to provide gay visitors to the new city with information about indexes of queer-friendly and schedules about local queer events. As queer visitors do not know the local culture in a new city and do not know how much of their identity they should reveal, the queer friendly index is provided. Besides, for those who wish to participate in local queer events in China, there is no official and visible notification, but rather an underground, small-group exchange of information. In order to facilitate the exchange, local queers can also utilize this application and contribute to the expansion of the overall database.

## b. Data Sources:
By collecting queer friendly locations in each block or district in a city, we create our own queer friendly index system based on the Healthcare Equality Index from Human Rights Campaign (not sure). Also, users can help collecting later data. The challenge is to get information 

## c. Audience:
Queer visitors and local queers in China

## d. Inspirations:
China Social Media: Weibo(Chinese Twitter), WeChat
Current Queer related app: Spartacus Gay Guide https://spartacus.gayguide.travel/
Queer Index report: Healthcare Equality Index https://www.hrc.org/resources/healthcare-equality-index

## e. Skills needed:
Research and maybe interview with queers to find out their needs;
Programing for the app

## d. Potential lunching cities:
Chengdu, Shanghai or Hong Kong
