From a contemporary perspective, the use of lines to represent time is almost intuitive, and this article provides a historical perspective on why such timelines eventually stand out from the various alternative representations. As more technologies emerge and evolve, the spatial and temporal information we can gather becomes more abundant, so there may be more creative temporal representations. Reviewing the less "practical" representations of the past can be helpful in designing temporal representations for the future as a possible path to deal with the limitations of timeline representation.
I think the polar area diagram is a common temporal visualization that differs significantly from the traditional linear representation.(https://datavizcatalogue.com/methods/nightingale_rose_chart.html)  As the data is represented around a fixed point, the time is visually more "cyclic" than the linear representation. It may help to represent information and ideas that have periodic patterns.
