## Idea #1

Content: An interactive map of the dissemination of different ethnic groups within the United States. The map would show movement from the birth of America to present day.
Audience: Students and scholars interested in human geography, as well as minority groups interested in how those alike have migrated across time within the U.S
Technology: Desktop Application
Core Question: What does the migration of the past tell us about certain groups and their respective upbringings, and what does it tell us about what the future of migration may look like across the country?
