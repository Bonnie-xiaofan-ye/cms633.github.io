title: Project Update (Danny's portion)
author: Daniel Kessler

My tasks for this project have been progressing as planned this week. I have worked on literature reviews (Russian propoganda and social media; annotation schemes of Internet memes) to better understand (a) how to capture memes that reflect the views and beliefs of pro-Russia actors on Reddit; and (b) improve our coding scheme. I have been updating our codebook and will be creating a coding sheet once another member of our team completes their task for this week. I've also updated our dataset to capture pro-Russian memes and created a dictionary classifying extraction and other terms for further analysis. More details to be provided during our presentation and can be found in our slides for this week:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1t4JbvLfTVsPYCnLLnA46DNEtu402_IQB62P--47Iwdg/edit#slide=id.g18f2a88eda6_0_0
