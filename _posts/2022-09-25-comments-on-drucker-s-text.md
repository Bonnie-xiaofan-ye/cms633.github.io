## Humanities Approached to Graphical Display
In Johanna Drucker's text, she discusses developing graphical displays that are rooted in interpretative activity. However, I disagree with this idea that our graphical expressions only make room for statistical analysis. While they may show quantitative data, such data can very well be interpreted in different ways, leaving one to wonder what the data is showing, what it can tell us about our past, what it can tell us about our future, why it has occured this way, and more. 

I do agree that the graphical displays that we do have are not designed for a humanistic discussion, but I don't beleive that such discussion cannot occur.
