title: Self-study_ Working With Data - Qingyu Cai

It is my first time using API and P5 to extract and visualize data, so it is somewhat challenging but full of fun. I successfully tried to extract the data of the ten oldest Dutch works at the Harvard Art Museum. Still, I failed in visualizing the data due to the coding mistake of undefined length for Dutch records, which I had no idea about what went wrong. 
This process of extracting and trying to visualize the data set reminds me of the article called data as capta. First, the question lies in how to change the data into capta, which means how to find the ambiguity in this data set. Then, how to visualize the capta by using tools such as P5 is another question. Can computers help to visualize the data in a human way? Or do we have to give the diagrams traits of humanities manually? And how should we decide the standard of making changes since this process is totally based on our decision? 
Based on those questions, I think itâ€™s essential to display the data and capta simultaneously, and point out the aim of capta visualization. Any humanity input should be based on this aim, and the explanation can help the audience capture the meaning while deciding whether such ambiguity makes sense. Besides, the audience can also develop innovative ideas in translating and visualization.
