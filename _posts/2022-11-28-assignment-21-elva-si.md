> The visualization of cultural collections, shouldnâ€™t aim at reproducing and consolidating the hegemonic claims of archives, but rather invite the viewer to critically question what is being viewed and the circumstances of its creation.
 
Frischknecht brought up an unique and essential approach to consider archives in a humanistic setting. As data is capta, digital archives should be capta, of which could be recording of natural phenomena and/or subjective perspectives. I really like the idea of asking users to participate into archiving cultural heritage collections since it could reduce the "sole decision-making power of what should be archived. Inviting and incorporating people's views and practices, especially those from cultural minority groups could benefit the collection of what would be passed to future generations. The matrix generator is effective and straightforward for users to identify the goals, aspects, concepts, and granularity for archives. I think we could create something similar in our interactive map to guide users contribute to the location/event information, as well as archiving past/closed places to record their memories or views.
