## Commentary on Max's research

From what I gathered after reading Max's research summary, through generative design we can continue to input a different number of design approaches, each with different values or requirements, until we find the most effective solution. In Max's case, he hopes to find the best way to visualize data surrounding cultural characteristics through his matrices which give him different possibilites of visualization, and through visualizing this data, he can answer or create tools that help to answer questions of the past. 


## Relevance for our project

For our project, we are aiming to show how design of certain objects has played out over time. Our visualization type is our timeline, but there may be different visualization variants that more effectively answer questions on our topic.
