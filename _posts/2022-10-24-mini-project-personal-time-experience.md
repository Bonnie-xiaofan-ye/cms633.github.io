For my time/space representation I was inspired by my experience at the Head of the Charles Regatta. Although a certain number of boats may be racing against each other at the same time, they do not all start together. It may look like one boat is far ahead of another when actually it just started ealier, making it look like its ahead of time. Additionally, not all boats are going to move at the same speed. The thicker lines represent a faster speed, making a faster time. When this happens, boats may eventually become staggered during the race, which becomes a concern as there are too many boats in too small of an area. To prevent any crashes, some boats may have to yield, stopping their time and putting it in irregular, inconsistent intervals.
