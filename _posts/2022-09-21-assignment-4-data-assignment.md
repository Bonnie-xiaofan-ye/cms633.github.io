## Nixon White House Recordings 

I used openRefine to study the Nixon tapes file, which had over 22,000 rows of entries, making it a little difficult to filter down to a set of data that was easy to digest without feeling like I was losing important information, which I feel lines up with Schoch's concerns on big data in today's reading. There were also filters that I wish were on openRefine, such as the length of each recording, but I don't think this is an issue with openRefine but rather one with the data in the file.
