title: 'Reading Assignment: Raw Data is an Oxymoron - Qingyu Cai'

Raw data seems to be literally. As mentioned in the reading, the author says, at first glance, data are apparently before the fact: they are the starting point for what we know, who we are, and how we communicate. This shared sense of starting with data often leads to an unnoticed assumption that data are transparent, that information is self-evident, the fundamental stuff of truth itself. However, raw data depends on culture, not just itself. It is the culture that interprets and imagines the meaning of the data. Raw data is not a natural resource. Instead, it is generated, gathered, and interpreted by culture. Based on different usage, data can be "cooked" differently. As a result, raw data embeds assumptions. In order to learn and use raw data well, it is crucial to promote interdisciplinary research.
