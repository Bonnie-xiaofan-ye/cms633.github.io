The data is about women shot during the Colombian independence war(1812-1820), including names, places and dates of death of women who supported Colombia's independence process. The data structure is simple: the six columns represent the first name, last name, place, year, month and day. No clustering was made during the cleanup process. The top 2 years of most women shot are 1816 & 1817, probably because they have most conflicts during the years or other reasons. Further analysis can be done on the place data, for example, visualize what area has more incidents on the map.
