The framework of Max Frischkent’s research on generative interfaces is enlightening in regards to questioning the objectivity of certain kinds of data, specifically archival data, which represents pieces of information that were selectively catered and chosen from a wider dataset. Just like what was previously discussed within prior works for DIgital Humanities, data is inherently objective structures that are selected subjectively to maintain an argument, and when presented in visualizations, add an extra layer of subjectivity as the data is framed in a particular way. To create an interface that allows the user to understand and interact with the process in analyzing data, provides an additional layer to the archives  for individuals with no prior knowledge of the subject matter to actively participate with and analyze the data. By doing so, Max’s research contributes to a characteristic that is needed in most fields, even outside of DIgital Humanities, a need to lower the barrier of entry to understanding the origins of relevant data.
