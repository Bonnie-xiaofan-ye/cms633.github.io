Digital humanities is defined in a variety of ways, and this article discusses the benefits and pitfalls of linking digital and humanities. I feel that the potential for improving traditional humanities study is immense, but that the interaction between digital and humanities represents the greatest obstacle. In my opinion, the relationship between technology and humanities should not be one of dependence, but rather one of mutual integration, from content to text to design. Our current reliance on electronic devices might easily mislead us into believing that digital is merely a tool, when in fact digital has its own system and design logic. How to apply this logic to the study and presentation of humanities is, in my opinion, the essence of digital humanities and where researchers and designers may truly shine.

As a project-based discipline, digital humanities requires the participation and assistance of various parties in addition to the traditional parts of humanities research. During the research era, it is vital to go beyond textual comprehension and integrate vast quantities of data in order to combine all aspects of knowledge. This entire study and production process is characterized by learning by making and doing. In addition, individuals, institutions, and companies must collaborate to support funding during the incubation stage and deliver the ultimate findings. 

Integration of many aspects, disciplines, and functions, in my opinion, is the essence of digital humanities. In the future, I anticipate the development of more structured collaborative application models that genuinely integrate digital's own logic and extend beyond content.
