> If there is a lesson here for the digital humanities it is simply this: just as interface cannot – finally – be decoupled from functionality, neither can aesthetics be decoupled from interface.

I find this quote intriguing, as the two go hand in hand when it comes to user interface. However, which is more important? The functionality or the aesthetic part? I think one can argue that if one isn't drawn to the interface aesthetically itself, then it's not a good interface. Even though it's functional, it might be harder for the user to navigate through it if it's not organized neatly or doesn't look good, making the app really "unbearable" to use. So at what point do you sacrifice functionality for aesthetics, or vice versa? Either way, it feels like you can't have a good application user interface if you don't have both. 

User interface is especially important since our project is based on conveying informationthrough a timeline, so having an accesible and aesthetically pleasing interface is crucial. But like the above principle, we meed to maintain the functionality of our project. We are going to try to draft up ideas to find out the best way to convey information while making the app enjoyable to use.
