MoMA - The Collection
1. Show first, don't ask
It does show a lot of works, but automatically arranges them by author, so that users can only see a lot of David Horvitz's work when they enter the site, and the filtering options are very unfriendly to newcomers.
2. Provide rich overviews
When clicking into the page of a single work, there is only some basic information, such as size, material, etc. There is almost no content, meaning, or introduction of the work, not to mention the related theory and field of introduction.
3. Provide samples
There is no information about samples and no contextual clues to encourage people to explore.
4. Provide context
There is almost no context, so people are confused after reading and do not understand any background information or story about the work.
5. Share high quality primary content. 
No high definition scans, no editable attachments, etc. Some works have only a blurred screenshot of the webpage, so it is impossible to read the information on it.
