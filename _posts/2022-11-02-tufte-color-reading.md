Tufte's first rule states that 
> Pure, bright or very strong colors have loud, unbearable effects when they stand unrelieved over large areas adjacent to each other, but extraordinary effectscan be achieved when they are used sparingly on or between dull back- ground tones.

For my example I chose to pick out a map of Cerulean City from the first generation line of Pokemon games (on the gameboy!) As you can see, the green of the grass and the blue of the water the map clashes directly when placed next to each other (kind of represents the 1+1=3 effect discussed where these two elements intersect and create an unwanted distraction from what's going on). In contrast, the squares, which represent landmark locations in the game, pop out because of the black square border used to mark out these locations on top of the muted cream path color, drawing attention to its importance.
