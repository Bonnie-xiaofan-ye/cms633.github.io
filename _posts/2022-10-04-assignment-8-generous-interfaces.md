I find the article's discussion of Generous Interfaces to be very intriguing; in fact, this is the first time I've heard of this concept. However, I did practice Generous Interfaces design to some extent while working on the project. Because the data is no longer restricted to academics, it is a significant part of my job as a designer to make information communication more straightforward. According to the article, the search function is extremely unfriendly to non-specialists and is both ineffective and time-consuming when we do not know the keywords. The most important aspect of the browse function, in my opinion, is that users are able to locate the categories, restrictions, etc. that they can select from on the browse page quickly and precisely. For instance, in the Prints and Printmaking Collection of the National Gallery of Australia project, there was an abundance of data, but I had to spend a considerable amount of time studying the system's interface in order to effectively utilize the entire database. Consequently, I believe that in the process of data visualization, we should not only consider how best to record the data, but also design the user interface so that the entire database is intuitive.
