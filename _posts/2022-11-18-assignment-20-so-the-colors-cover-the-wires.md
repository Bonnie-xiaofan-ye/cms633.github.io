"So the Colors Cover the Wires": Interface, Aesthetics, and Usability by Matthew G. Kirschenbaum

This is a classic work that combines the senses of sight, sound and touch. The appearance of the CD Player and the exhaust fan are fused, and you pull the string that hangs down, and the music plays. This straightforward approach establishes a relationship between the designer and the product, and between the product and the user. This is Naoto Fukasawa's well-known design concept "Without Thought", which is to design according to the naturally existing user needs. The core of unconscious design is to translate people's unconscious behavior and intuition into physical products that are visible to the naked eye, and to satisfy needs in the most natural and direct way, as if everything were undesigned. Returning to the origin of things and connecting the design behind the product with the positive use of the product is an extremely high design perspective and dimension. On a mobile app, every UI detail of the visual designer will serve to guide the user. The shading and color contrast of the buttons will tell the user where you want him to click. The typography and font size display of information and text will tell the user what you want him to focus on. This all happens naturally, without the user having to deliberately guess and trial and error, and automatically connects the visual language to the behavior when the interface is presented to them.
