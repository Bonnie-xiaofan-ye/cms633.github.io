comment on the aspects that have changed your understanding of interfaces, especially the GUI, and what kind of impact they might have on your final project. 

I really liked what was discussed in the section titled "The Artist of the Beautiful." I feel that naturally I'm more drawn to a more beautiful interface, but I also feel like I've alway appreciated art and design a lot, so I thought that this made sense. However, I learned that having a beautiful interface is so important for a software because its technology is so complex. Because we want to separate ourselves from the computer and what's actually going on behind the scenes, having a beautiful interface is so important to do so.
