This reading covers many of the same ideas that the blog post did, but in much more depth, and with confirmation of the ideas from the empirical study. I found the truncated and inverted axis techniques to be the most decieving to me. They are especially decieving if one is only looking at the image for a quick period of time. For example, with a truncated axis, one is unlikely to see whether or not the y axis minimum/maximums have been enlarged, and even if one does, it still raises the question of whether or not this change was done intentionally as a means of deception, intentionally to highlight some piece of information, or just unintentionally.
