This article named data as capta arouses both my interest and reflection as a designer and newcomer to the field of digital humanities. 

The title data as capta has the power to let readers read through the paper with a question about what capta is. Capta is different from data because it is qualitative and co-dependently constituted, which allows us to shift from certainty to ambiguity. As a designer, I am much more attracted by the examples with diagrams from the author. Different graphs show us expressions of data and capta way of visualization, which are powerfully distinct from one another. I would say without reading this article; I would be the one who visualizes the data with assumptions, which are all self-evident. We are envisioning the data, not capta. And why we do this because we haven’t brought any humanities thought into this visualization process, which, however, contains many assumptions based on what diagrams we have seen before. These diagrams look scientific and logical, but without humanities. I am impressed by the vivid example the author mentioned toward the end of this paper. He compared three different people’s moods while waiting for the bus. Time is a great example to showcase the difference between rationality and emotionality.

While looking forward to the final project, I found it rather exciting to visualize the data. However, I question how to make sure that the visualization of capta reflects reality. To be specific, the time difference between different people exists. Still, my question is how to quantify such a difference because human feeling is not something that can be easily transferred based on one standard dimension. It remains a question for us but also leaves possibilities.
