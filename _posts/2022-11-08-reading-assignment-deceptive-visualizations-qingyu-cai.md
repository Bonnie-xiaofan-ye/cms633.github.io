I find the inverted axis as the most deceptive technique. Firstly, this technique ignores the convention, and readers won't realize the trick without being reminded. The first time I read the short passage by Ravi Parikh, I was treated by the graph the author showed. Not until the author mentioned that the graph's Y-axis was upside-down did I realize that I had misunderstood the chart reversely. Secondly, the impact of the convention is much more substantial than we have imagined because people accept it as always-correct principles, which is hard for people to change this mindset. For instance, even if readers realize that the Y-axis is upside-down,  it's still hard for us to accept this representation. Finally, the message created by the inverted axis is reversal instead of message exaggeration or understatement, which means that it totally changes the message's meaning. As a result, readers would interpret the meaning wrong without noticing the axis.
