The image above illustrates my experiences of our first ultrasound, 6 months ago, when we learned that we were having a miscariage, as compared with our newest experience last week (with a different pregnancy), learning that our child was healthy. The first pregnancy was filled with stress, and our experience with the second was affected deeply by our experience with the first. During the car ride over to the second ultrasound, my wife kept squeezing my hand, and each time I would start thinking about our experience with the first ultrasound. Once we learned that our baby was healthy, in Ultrasound 2, I was filled with a myriad of emotions. Tension reduced, but then increased once we both realized how much work there was to do. The recent experiences "out of time" informed the subsequent experiences "out of time" in reference to the first ultrasound.
