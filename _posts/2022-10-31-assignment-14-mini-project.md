Our group continues to use the spatial, temporal and textual data of the erotic enjoyment history. We tried to use _Palladio_ yet found it difficult to display data in the system, highly possible due to the mismatch of the data format.While year, month, day are usually lined up to represent time, there are so many formats to represent locations - coordinates, names, etc, and it is relatively hard to change from one form to the other. Therefore, we prefer to choose  tools that can support coordinate system for visualization. Out of all the tools being provided, **StoryMaps** by ArcGIS suits our need the most. We have the flexible to organize events into a timeline, give narration to each event, and posit the events to different locations. 

Please see below for our final project:
