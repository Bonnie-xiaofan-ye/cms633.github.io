title: Comments on Tufte's Narrative of Time and Space
author: Sophia Pineda
---
In this chapter, Tufte discusses the ongoing process of taking data and narratives that include multi-dimensional components of space and time and putting them onto a flat representation. He discusses how this process has been done throughout the course of history, showing an early example of Galileo's representations of Jupiter's satellites. These representations must maintain spatial relationships, otherwise risking misinterpretation by the audience. This is where the practice of good design plays an important role. No matter the visual that is trying to be created, certain display techniques create a better representation, which Tufte notes as "small multiples, close text-figure integration, parallel sequences, details and panorama, and polyphony of layering and separation, data compression into content-focused dimensions, and avoidance of redundancy."
