My visualization shows how time feels distored when running. The dialation of time can be seen with how it feels to run each 0.5 mile. In reality they should be spaced out equally across the timeline but subjectively it feels like the beginning and end 0.5 miles feel shorter while the middle 0.5 mile from 2.5 mile to 3.0 mile is the longest. I attribute this to the amount of precieved stress and fatigue the body is going through at these different distances which makes it easy for the mind to focus on the pain and how it may be precieved to be happeninng longer. This effect is well documented in psychology and in the readings we have read throughout the semester so far. For the subjective observer time is not only stretches and compress in a linear sense but also can get overlayed ontop of itself if a person thinks and feels the emotions of the future or past in a present moment.
