In terms of the state distribution that sponsors police surveillance devices, California, New Jersey, and Michigan overwhelmingly have the most amount of accounted surveillance devices. The major technology of choice for California, Michigan, and New Jersey are the Automated License Reader, Facial Recognition Software, and Body Worn Cameras respectively. It is interesting how different states have more popular technology in terms of police surveillance, which could also contribute to the varying crimes/crime rates that appear in certain areas. Although the primary surveillance system of choice is Body Worn Cameras. 

What I found interesting are the amount of devices that have unknown vendors for the technology: it comprises the majority of surveillance devices. Maybe itâ€™s due to the fact that the technology is so outdated, that the brands who made these original devices have gone bankrupt. 

In terms of who used these technologies, and where they are being utilized. The primary utilizers are the police, and the primary jurisdiction is a municipal district. Since most of the devices are body worn cameras, it is no surprise that the primary use is when police officers are on duty.
