1)“Archive”
The article discussed the origins of Archive and how it has changed as digitalization has evolved. As mentioned in some of the earlier readings in the semester, there is a lot of discussions about how to archive website data or dynamic media data. Who has the right to organize the archive? Who will have access to read or edit these archive? What kind of media should be archived? Because the owners or the organizers of the archives have consciously or unconsciously included their bias to the archiving process, the history or reality reflected or represented by the archives will always be partial and subjective. Therefore, we should emphasize the diversity of archive creators. With different archives coming from people who look at the society from different perspectives, we are more likely to have a "whole" representation of reality.

2)“Dynamic Media Memories”
Compared to traditional static media, the advantage of dynamic media is that it is more flexible for extraction and editing. One limitation of dynamic media is how people decide whether the data flowing through media memories should get an "end of flow" to storage and even archive.
For example, in TV media, formal TV programs such as news are usually recorded for storage, while most of the TV time is for advertisements. Should it be recorded through video recording data like news reports even though they are actually repeating themselves? Or should they be stored through counting numbers? What would be lost during the media transformation?

3) “Underway to the Dual System”
The author illustrated the differences between traditional archives and digital media archives in many ways, such as the separation of storage and presenting in digital archives, the essential components of archived media (language letters or 0/1), and so on. Digital archives are based on software for presentation, which links data in hardware (0/1) and media stimulus for human perceptions(image, sound, text, etc.). Therefore, digital archives are generally unstable for individual users because they do not own the hardware that store the archives and the software that access the archive data and transform the mathematic components to media forms, but only have access to the presented media formats. It will lead to some challenges for the users in terms of archive transfer or advanced data processing. And for digital archives, their authority is challenged because the people who control the software and hardware essentially have power to decide what data can be archived and how it can be archived (what algorithms are used to process the 0/1 to produce the desired media data).
