This week's readings broaden my understanding of what "archives" mean. In the traditional sense, archives can help to discover historical records and truths that have been hidden or lost. Based upon what are archived and how they are stored, future generations may come up with a completely different interpretation of the past compared with the reality or they may be limited to search out counter-histories. 

Since archives have weaker classifications and greater amounts of material that is boxed or shelved under chronological or general headings, they provide more space and depth for interpretations. From a humanistic perspective, we can raise the question of who makes the history and what is missing from the history based on the available archives. We can also find connections among various archives speading across the global, including but not limited to keywords, images, linkages between space and time etc. Possibly, we can find priceless records and icons that have a high degree of contingency.

Archives could also serve a function that I did not realize before. They could be places for creating and re-working memory. For our final project, we are thinking about including closed LGBTQ+ places and events in the map. For example, Shanghai Pride Parade, LGBTQ Film Festival, Eddy's Bar (Gay Bar), Lucca 390 (Gay Bar). These places and events are shut down due to government regulations or COVID influences. The archive in this map can be a powerful tool to support future generations memorizing the places' and events' existence and/or re-create something similar in the near future.
