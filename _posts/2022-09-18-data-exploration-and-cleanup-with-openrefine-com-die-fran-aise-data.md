## Insights on Comédie-Française data 
From both the plays.csv and registers.csv files I am able to see what genre of plays were shown at the Comédie-Française, who the author of the plays were, how many acts the plays had, what day of the week the play was put on, and more. From the information that I have seen, I noticed that comédie and tragédie were the most common genres and the most common author of plays put on was Florent Carton. I also noted that the most common day for a play to be put on was Monday, which I found really interesting, and I am unsure as to why this is the case.

As for my experience with OpenRefine, I found it helpful to be able to view items by category, especially with such a large set of information. Errors that messed with the organization of data seemed to be from spelling and usage of spaces, but once the error is realized, it is easy to fix by choosing to make a specific change to all identical rows. One issue that I found was that some of the titles of certain categories get cut off because they are too long and I could not find a way to be able to view the full title. There may be a way, but it was not obvious to me.
