## Insights on Comédie-Française data 
From both the plays.csv and registers.csv files I am able to see what genre of plays were shown at the Comédie-Française, who the author of the plays were, how many acts the plays had, what day of the week the play was put on, and more. From the information that I have seen, I noticed that comédie and tragédie were the most common genres and the most common author of plays put on was Florent Carton. I also noted that the most common day for a play to be put on was Monday, which I found really interesting, and I am unsure as to why this is the case.
