The reading Towards Generous Interfaces for Archival Collections gives us five design principles. When browsing the MoMA Collection website, it shows that this website has met four out of five principles suggested by Mitchell Whitelaw.
The homepage meets the demand of showing first and allows users to search by a query. The display of the collections lets users feel their generosity, and it also gives us the number of selected and total works. Users can filter the collections by category and time. And it also allows for a recent acquisition. Besides, users can also know if the work is on view in the museum or not, which offers the users another chance to see the work in person.
When clicking on specific work, users can quickly check the detailed information regarding author, dimensions, medium, object number, series the work belongs to, and department. Furthermore, users will also learn if the work is part of a series, if the author has any other works collected here, and the number of works in the same department. However, there is one problem I met when browsing the pictures, which fails to obey the rules of sharing high-quality primary content. The website allows me to view the image in full-screen size, but it can not be further zoomed in to see the details. Those who want to see the details cannot accomplish that, and reading the texts in the pictures is too hard.
