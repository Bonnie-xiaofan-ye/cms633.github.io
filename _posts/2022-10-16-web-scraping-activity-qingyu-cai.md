I downloaded the Octoparse for web scraping the website of THE RIJKSMUSEUM's painting collections about the landscape. At first, I failed to export all the image data from the website. After searching for tutorials on the website, I found some solutions in terms of general settings before exporting the data, for instance, increasing the time out to ensure enough time to go to the webpage. Besides, if the target website won't load data other than those you see before you scroll, it has opted for a lazy loading strategy. We need to tell Octoparse to scroll down the page after loading it. These are some solutions I have tried to export the data. However, I still found that there were still six images missing on this webpage. The exported CSV files are pretty clean and seldom need to be cleaned up. And I am not sure if it is one of the advantages of Octoparse. Besides, Octoparse allows users to clean up and organize the data directly on its application even before exporting.
