- The subject of humanities already offers significant importance to people's life. We can learn about critical insights, creative designs, speculative imagination, and methods of comparative, historically informed study through the studies. These skillsets help us introspect and claim our positioning in a turbulent world. The subject of digital humanities expands upon this concept, aiming to address and engage subjects across media, language, location, and history. It bridges the gap between traditional humanities (e.g. print) and the intensively digitalized environment.

- From scalable databases to information visualizations, from video lectures to multiuser virtual platforms, digital humanities welcome different kinds of platforms and media. It is enlightening to see how visuals interact, complement, enhance the textual words. The digital humanists also keep an open mind to transform texts into data and visual designs, implement iterative experiments and consider failure as a form of progression.
