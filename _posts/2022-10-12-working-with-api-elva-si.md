I used Harvard Art Museum API documentation to extract the color API [Color API]. (https://api.harvardartmuseums.org/color?apikey=69dff82d-b6eb-4a76-a9c0-1f54e877b0b9&size=60) When I visited Harvard Art Museum earlier, I observed the researchers' dedication in studying ancient pigments and modern substitutions. Therefore, I am interested in how Harvard Art Museum documents its color collection. 

Via the API data extraction, I can see 147 color records. Each color is documented by color id, name, and hex (e.g. 8a2be2). However, I failed to find out how these colors are represented through the museum collection and when the colors were created. I believe it would be interesting to identify if certain colors were frequently used in artwork of a particular time period or art genre.
