I tried to represent my media consumption (movies/TV shows/books) over the last two quarters of Year 2021. Each cell represents a day and if a cell is filled with a particular color, it indicates my consumption. The dark the color, the more consumption I had in one day. With this graph, I came to realize how my time is distributed through a day, a month, and a year, especially how the time interacts with my frequency and intensity of consumption. It can also tell my spare time versus busy season towards the end of a year.
