This timeline describes my experience at a symphony performance. At the beginning, I was super focused and attracted to the music then I get tired, time seemed "normal" for me. Then I got distracted, losing focus due to some reasons, then time felt quite short. Suddenly, some high notes of the music attracted me agian and agai. Later I felt boring, thinking else where again, and time felt passing fast. When it came to an end, I focused back to the piece and the ending section of the music.
