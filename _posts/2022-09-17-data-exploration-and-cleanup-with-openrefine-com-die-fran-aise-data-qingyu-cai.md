  Data Exploration and Cleanup with OpenRefine – Comédie-Française Data: Qingyu

The two OpenRefine files show digitized information about the original manuscript of a theatre record. These two data files include information about the performances/plays, such as author, title, genre, number of acts, style, with or without prologue, when they are on in the theatre, how popular they are, and irregular receipts name. 

With OpenRefine, one can easily find the listed categories as key information about each play. Besides, one can use these listed categories to see clustered information. However, errors would occur when there is redundant space when typing. So, people who digitize the information should be careful with this and use filters to double-check to ensure the information's correctness.
