_**Insights into Data:**_ It is no wonder that the period is called _Comedie-Francaise_, since genres that had plays written during this period were mostly comedies, or a combination of comedy and another genre according to the play.csv. There was no primary author who took the period by storm, since a variety of different authors contributed to the comedy genre in France. They were all of variable lengths, but a majority of the plays had 5 acts. The plays were equally spread out through the weekdays according to the register.csv.
