## Interactive Map of Dissemination by Ethnic Group in the U.S
Problem Statement/Research Question? How and when have certain ethnic groups traveled throughout the history of America
Data Sources: Data gathered by the Census Bureau on population and population by race. While this will tell me population by year, it may not directly tell me the direction certain groups were travelling in. It may also be hard to gather such data for the earlier years in America's history. 
Intended Audience: This project can be useful for the general public due to its representation of everyone, but scholars/students interested in race/migration and human geography may find a greater affinity for the project. 
Inspirations: U.S Census Bureau's Census Flows Mapper: https://flowsmapper.geo.census.gov/map.html Interactive Human Migration Map by the California Academy of Sciences: http://legacy.calacademy.org/human-odyssey/map/
Skills Needed: Programming in js, html, css, web design, analyzing research, gis
