title: Palladio Experience
---
I used Palladio to analyze Melville's travels in London. I was not able to successfully do so, however, due to my limitations of understanding how to use the software. I was able to get some points on the map visualization tool but the timeline and the facet display wasn't really working despite my best attempts to clean up the data and make it work. This is probably user error on my end I think. 

In an attempt to try and understand how Palladio works though, I  decided to try out the sample data set Palladio provided.

Some observations from using Palladio: 
- can visualize spatial data in the map using seperate layers, very useful for distinguishing diff data types !!
- ^^ you can also switch up the tile types. it can range in complexity, from just simple land to even laying out streets.
- the timeline feature is very neat! you can switch up what you want the timeline to graph. it has a grouping by dimension tool so you can display your data in a diff category (for example, if you choose location, it will break the dataup into a particular location.. i don't know if i can explain that right but it's easier to understand if you actually play around with the tool ;) ) 
- i like the facets feature. it basically shows a particular "facet" of the data based on what you choose, this is really helpful if you only want to see a specific subset of your data. you can also select multiple dimensions and it will take that into consideration and display it accordingly. 

I checked out storymap JS, and it is really limited compared to Palladio, notreally as dimensional and complex in displaying  spatial data compared to Palladio pretty straightforward (you can put in coordinates
and it affixes it to a map to display).
