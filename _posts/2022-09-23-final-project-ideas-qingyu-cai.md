There're, in total, two initial ideas for the final project. 

The first is to use the interactive experience to improve the museum visit experience. For instance, we can incorporate the AR technique into our visiting App to help assist understanding. While identifying one piece of work, the screen can tell you the name of it, a brief introduction, resources, etc. Besides, visitors are more than welcome to save it in a personal account if a particular piece of work inspires them.

The second idea is to establish an online learning platform to inspire children's interest in history and culture. With interactive experience inserted, this web-based learning platform can include different forms of learning such as video and audio, a game that allows playing with data, etc.
