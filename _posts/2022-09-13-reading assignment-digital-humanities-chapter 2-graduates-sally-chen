1ï¼‰Visualization and data design
Data visualization is one of my areas of interest and it's relatively familiar to me. From my undergraduate research experience in psychology, I can appreciate what it means to say "Visualization can be used in many other ways to sketch out an argument or to map its constituent parts or even to model its initial formulation." Summarizing the statistical results of experimental data is usually done through graphs and charts, and by including different data and setting different coordinates, the information in the graphs can answer different research questions. Therefore, I believe data visualization promotes a significant change in the field of humanities, where researchers can express their opinions or present their understanding of a particular issue through active engagement in the project design.

2) Humanities Gaming
Although gaming still has a rather negative reputation in academia, it has entered the realm of digital humanities. Gamification is helpful in increasing engagement and motivation, hopefully it can help create deeper learning in the audience (compared with shallow learning which is more about memory and understanding). This field will gain more potential benefits to digital humanities with the developement of the gaming industry and emerging technology including VR or AR.
