title: ' Comments on Data Scholarship in the Humanities'
author: Sophia Pineda
---
The author touches a lot on the collection of sources for humanistic research. At one point, they discuss how the excavation of artifacts for this type of research can impact the original site too much, which brings in an ethical debate in this line of research. However, with digital documentation, we can capture these observations in a much less physically destructive way, giving a lot of importance to the world of Digital Humanities. Additionally in the discussion of sources, the author mentions the difficulty in determining what is and is not a potential source of data for humanities research, and even with so many objects that can be interepreted, each object individually can be interepreted in so many different ways. This is really what differs the humanities from the sciences and social sciences. There is a great deal of interpretation and further representation of a certain source depending on its context and on the goal of the collector.
