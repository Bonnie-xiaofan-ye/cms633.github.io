The form of digital media has dramatically changed compared with print time due to the influence of new contexts and environments. In such a context, various forms have emerged to collaboratively construct digital humanities practices by integrating different skills and knowledge. Among them, these two methods, distant/close, macro/micro, surface/depth, and database documentaries, are what I would like to talk about.

### distant/close, macro/micro, surface/depth
This method is about the importance of both close and distant reading in digital humanities practices. Close reading, as the traditional way of humanities, allows for detailed capture of textual evidence, references, word choices, semantics, and registers. In contrast, distance reading can allow researchers to detect large-scale trends, patterns, and relationships. These two scales of reading methods can help dig out different findings, which can be used for different purposes and somehow complement each other. Current technologies in digital humanities allow researchers to work in both ways when necessary. More importantly, regardless of macro or micro reading, it is crucial to situate the data in differential geographies to compare and deeply dive into more relationships and new findings. 

### database documentaries
The multilinear character of database documentaries allows for variable experience and user activation, creating a new experience for users. The fluidity of information leads to various forms of presentation and interaction. For instance, in todayâ€™s museums or exhibitions, visitors can interact with data in front of a screen to check what they are interested in. However, back in mere humanities time, audiences could just read static paper materials, sometimes even feeling bored. The creation of database documentaries opens up new possibilities for people to digest and learn documents, which helps more people to understand and spread the culture.
