The “Humanities to Digital Humanities” chapter focuses on the theme of traditional humanities with modern computational methods. As a field, the discipline has several thousand years of history behind it, while the Internet is only a few decades old. I agree with the idea that humanities are radically transforming as the Internet continues to dominate. As a species, humans are undergoing a radical transformation with innovative technology, so it makes sense that the field of humanities reflects such a change. 

I also agree with the distinction between the older focus on humanism to the newer focus of humanities. The difference between humanism, humanities, and now digital humanities does a good job of presenting growth in how the topic has evolved over time and how it is still evolving. Yet, digital humanities are not a reinvention of an old concept, it is an extension of an old idea, brought to life with new technology. 

One idea I disagree with this is the notion that intellectual challenges will be the main driver of digital humanities going forward. We need to acknowledge some of the technical challenges present in the complexity of new technology and the ease of international communication. For example, an American student studying humanities will have a different language and cultural viewpoint compared to a Chinese student. The digital age has made it possible for both to work together, but each side will look at humanity from a different perspective. Barriers in language and personal philosophies have always been an issue, but finding ways to effectively overcome such barriers is a challenge we should not overlook.
