Kirschenbaum, "So the Colors Cover the Wires"
The interface is framed as the most crucial part when designing a product that requires end users to view with the commentary. This insight is especially pervasive as he is targeting regular digital humanities researchers attempting to abide by specific deadlines, targeting us specifically, to which they focus on data collection rather than the end product for the user. I remember coming across apps that I deemed unusable, because the interface was too old or unattractive, but I do not think I made the connection as to work it would take to customize an appealing interface. 
The commentary also displays irony, as most of the interfaces the writer deems as great interfaces, I would not show the same appreciation. This means that there is also a time aspect to developing interfaces, as the more advanced the technological age is, the more the need to be constantly upgraded within the design to appeal to the user persists.
