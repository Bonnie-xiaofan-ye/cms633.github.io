"Bruce Tognazzini, who has had a distinguished career at Apple, celebrates a visible (as opposed to a merely graphical) interface: "A visible interface is a complete environment in which users can work comfortably, always aware of where they are, where they are going, and what objects are available to them along the way" (Tognazzini 1992: xiii). "

This paragraph is a good overview of some characteristics that a good interface should have, and one of the key points is showing what is available. For our queer map project, the main purpose of our interface is to allow users to quickly acquire up-to-date and detailed LGBTQ-related information. Therefore, we need to find the balance between offering as much detailed information as possible and creating the easiest pathway to a certain outcome (in my mind, it means providing the minimum necessary information for decision-making). For now, the minimum information we provide in the first interface includes the event/location type and location information. Since the final design has not yet been determined, if we were adding a listing feature into the interface, what kinds of basic information would help the user decide whether to click into the events/locations for more information? It needs to be further decided based on design experience and user insight.
