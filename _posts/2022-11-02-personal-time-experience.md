In order to illustrate the difference between my perception of time and the objective time shift, I aimed to see how many times I checked my watched during each hour of the day. The day in question was Thursday, October 27th. The more times I checked my watch during an hour, I analyzed as time seemingly slowing down since I had consciously kept track of seconds/minutes passing a specific time. Time effectively slowing downn, this represents a shift in the perception of what an hour truly represents in a day.
