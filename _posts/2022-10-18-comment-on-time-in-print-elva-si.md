Alongside Edward Tufte's article, Rosenberg and Grafton's arguments widen my perception of time representations throughout history. This was my first time to realize that our idea of time is wrapped up with the implicit metaphors of time as a linear continuum. When we say ‘long’ and ‘short’ times, ‘intervals’ (literally, ‘space between’), ‘before’ and ‘after,’ time is a line where taking it apart is impossible. I appreciate the exploration to add more complex layers on top of the linear continuum. It is exciting to see diagrams that reflect the comparisons and contrasts of historical events and the irregular historical branches. I particularly like the diagram by Charles Renouvier, in which uppercase letters represent actual events, and lowercase letters events that did not happen from 1876. Such diagrams could help audience to see a much more comprehensive visual representation of the historical events.
