I mostly agree with Danah Boyd's arguments for big data. In particular, I resonate a lot with the second argument: Claims to Objectivity and Accuracy are Misleading and the fifth argument: Just Because it is Accessible Doesn’t Make it Ethical.

> There remains a mistaken belief that qualitative researchers are in the business of interpreting stories and quantitative researchers are in the business produce facts.

Quantitative research methods are so often deemed as "facts." With more and more big data joining the party, the division between these two scientific methods may become wider. However, as Boyd mentioned, all researchers are interpreters of data. A model may be mathematically sound, an experiment may seem valid, but as soon as a researcher seeks to understand what it means, the process of interpretation has begun. We need to remind ourselves that data is primarily human-made. “Data-driven” doesn’t mean “unmistakably true." We should get rid of the mindset of absolute control and universal truth of big data and, instead, embrace an understanding that big data is another form of subjectivity. 

> With Big Data emerging as a research field, little is understood about the ethical
implications of the research being done. Should someone be included as a part of a large
aggregate of data? What if someone’s ‘public’ blog post is taken out of context and
analyzed in a way that the author never imagined?

While I am doing the database research for the final project, I was stunned by this argument. Many of my current project interests lay in areas like TV production, social media (which bring up another question on data accessibility), which stopped me from keeping ethical issues behind lines.csv in mind. But Boyd's perspective brought up an important point that just because content is publicly accessible doesn’t mean that it was meant to be consumed by just anyone. We need to constantly ask ourselves about the ethics of their data collection, analysis, and publication.
