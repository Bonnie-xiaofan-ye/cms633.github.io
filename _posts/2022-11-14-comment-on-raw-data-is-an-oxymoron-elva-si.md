title: Comment on Raw Data Is an Oxymoron_Elva Si
---

comment on the often used concept of “raw data”.

Raw data 

they are “ friendly ” to users in part according to the ways they empower us to store, manipulate, and transmit data.

The phrase raw data — like jumbo shrimp — has understandable appeal

At first glance data are apparently before the fact: they are the
starting point for what we know, who we are, and how we communicate. This shared
sense of starting with data often leads to an unnoticed assumption that data are transparent,
that information is self-evident, the fundamental stuff of truth itself.
