The article elaborated on the possible impacts and implications the Big Data phenomenon might have on our life. 
Chapter 6 raises the question about the rights of accessibility to big data and points out the unevenness of the system:' those inside social media company would have privileged access to different datasets.' This unfairness and lack of regulation in accessibility data also make Big Data a powerful tool for political manipulations. For example, during the presidential elections, the huge amount of data generated through tweets and polls on social media was used by political strategists to derive insights and work out what message is best to target and engage the voters. 
Chapter 3 'big data are not always good data, ' calls attention to the authenticity and accuracy of big data and how uncertain data could lead to precarious outcomes. An example I thought of is how some Instagram influencers fake their way to online fame by buying fake followers. According to an influencer Bilton, "Bot followers are created by hackers and programmers who write code that scour the internet to steal countless random identities by pilfering people's photos, names, and bios There are." also substantial ethical problems involved as people's photos are public on the internet that people can screenshot without asking for permission.
