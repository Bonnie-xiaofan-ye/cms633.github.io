The use of GIS for Spatial Humanities is controversial. Although, for now, GIS seems to be considered a tool for spatial representation, the author also discuss in the article about the implications of using GIS for research methodology. There are potential epistemological assumptions that come with the use of specific tools and methods, such as the assumption that  know the objective world through sound methods and data. If GIS can be more open and flexible about what can be represented in the system, then researchers might be able to reflect their philosophical thinking in ways such as using some layers to express possible biases in the data being used or some alternative explanation of what we have known.
