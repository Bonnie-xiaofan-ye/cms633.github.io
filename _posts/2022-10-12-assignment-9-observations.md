## Working with Harvard Art Museum's API

I have never extracted data via an API before, or worked with an API, so the whole process was a little challenging for me. I tried looking through the code of the common cultures and viewing it as an array, but was unsure as to how to create the histogram. The other project with the timeline of bronze pieces was easier to work with. The timeline could be modified by making the years that had multiple bronze pieces larger/longer in order to represent this. Right now, a year that only has one piece is given the same weight as a year with more.
