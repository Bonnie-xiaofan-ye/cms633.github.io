## Big? Smart? Clean? Messy? Data in the Humanities

Sch√∂ch discusses what data is and how it can be in a form of either smart data and big data. Smart data is on a much smaller scale, more explicit, and structured. However, due to this, creating smart data requires a large amount of manual work in order to classify content, which is why smart data is on a much smaller scale. Big data, on the other hand, is large in volume, constantly being generated, and heterogenous in variety. Because thousands of entries are being analyzed at once, its difficult to take the greatest possible advantage of the data set. With this, schoch proposes that we need bigger smart data or smarter big data to compensate for the losses of both sides.
