While I’m thinking about what I wanted to do for my final project, I searched some online resources for interesting humanities projects. I got fascinated by the website The Pudding (https://pudding.cool). It’s a website that uses digital humanities techniques to comment on today’s culture, I think it provides good examples of what digital humanities is and I appreciate how the projects can be used to make impacts on current social issues. In my mind, the final project can be something like one of the pudding “stories”. I’m interested in analyzing social media data of underrepresented groups (e.g, women, people with disabilities).
