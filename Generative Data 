Max writes that "the visualization of cultural collections, shouldnâ€™t aim at reproducing and consolidating the hegemonic claims of archives, but rather invite the viewer to critically question what is being viewed and the circumstances of its creation", and that is what we want to try to do with our project. Instead of just portraying information, we want the user to  spark questions and connections about the data being presented, much like how like museums (like the MIT museum) curate collections around a theme that leaves the visitors questioning about them.
