The way data is portrayedd to users can make a huge difference in how we perceive and understand it as told by these 2 articles. There can be multiple ways to represent data (as visualization is up to user interpretion), however some ways to represent it are more deceptive than others, making the user focus on only certain aspects of some data or to believe a certain thing about the data being shown. I was really surprised about the y-axis trick the most - I never really noticed this as a tactic until now, but now that I have learned of it, it's definitely more common around than i thought. The exaggeration of the y-axis tricks our mind to perceive something as more of a drastic change than it really is.
